# AdeptWin32Examples
Window's GUI Examples in Adept

### How to compile
- Make sure that your Adept compiler supports version `2.7`
- Navigate into one of the example projects (e.g. `cd button`)
- Run `adept` to compile (or `adept --windows` if cross-compiling)
- Optionally, you can use the `-e` flag to immediately run the resulting executable (e.g. `adept -e`)
