main.exe.manifest is the manifest file for our application.

It does two main things:

- Enables modern styling by telling Windows to use Common Controls 6
- Enables UTF-8 for win32 FunctionA() routines

Our resource file (`main.rc`) will mention the manifest, which is
how Windows will know about it
